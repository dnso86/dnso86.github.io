# Isdal Woman name finder
This is a tool to help finding out the scraped-off name from one piece of the evidence collected in the [Isdal Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isdal_Woman) case. Some additional links at the [bottom](#do-you-remember-this-woman?) of this page.

## The idea

The evidence - a tube of eczema cream - is pictured [here](https://imgur.com/a/GWErhsA). There is another, large image of it [here](1ivtA9cvDXk6cGu2tuk39Qxd_19Mb9TWlcZkfZSXv7Og.jpg).

The idea is identifying the original text based on the leftovers, by brute-forcing a list of possibly relevant first and last names against characters we think we could still recognise.

- The label was made on a typewriter, therefore it is monospaced - the characters are fixed-length.
- The first name probably consisted of seven characters.

It is useful to find images of *sans-serif* typefaces used in the typewriters of the sixties for comparison. The Lucida Sans font is somewhat similar:

## Options

- It is possible to choose different lists of names on the right side.
- Custom names can be added as: `Alpha,Bravo,Charlie` etc., and will be treated as the built-in ones.
- If *Fixed length names* is checked, the length of a possible name should be equal to the length we look for - if it is 4, and we set the first `A`, then `Anne,Abby,Alma` etc. will be found.
- But if it is unchecked, the shorter names will be found too - `Ali,Ana,Amy` in addition to the 4-character long ones.

## Presets

There are a few settings pre-defined - so to get a rough idea, just click on the *My idea 1* button for instance. Also if you can only recognize a round character at the beginning and perhaps an *I* afterwards, try the *Minimal* preset - it just shows results for that.

## License notes

The whole original idea stems from the book *Kvinnen i Isdalen*, by Dennis Zacher Aske - ISBN 9788241916601.
