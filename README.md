# Isdal Woman Name Finder

This is an online tool running in any up-to-date browser helping finding out partially missing / assumed to be modified names from evidence collected in the [Isdal Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isdal_Woman) case. The basic idea is identifying an original name based on the leftovers, by brute-forcing a list of possibly relevant first and last names against characters we think we could still recognise.

**See [Isdal Woman’s Name — Scraped Off?](https://medium.com/@od8086/isdal-womans-name-scraped-off-00b55eaca367) for a detailed description :heavy_exclamation_mark:**

> The original idea stems from the book *Kvinnen i Isdalen*, by Dennis Zacher Aske - ISBN 9788241916601.

## Description

### Options

- It is possible to choose different lists of names on the right side.
- Custom names can be added as: `Alpha,Bravo,Charlie` etc., and will be treated as the built-in ones.
- If *Fixed length names* is checked, the length of a possible name should be equal to the length we look for - if it is 4, and we set the first `A`, then `Anne,Abby,Alma` etc. will be found.
- But if it is unchecked, the shorter names will be found too - `Ali,Ana,Amy` in addition to the 4-character long ones.

### Presets

There are a few settings pre-defined - so to get a rough idea, just click on the *My idea 1* button for instance. Also if you can only recognize a round character at the beginning and perhaps an *I* afterwards, try the *Minimal* preset - it just shows results for that.
