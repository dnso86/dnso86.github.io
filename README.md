# Isdal Woman name finder
This is an online tool running in any up-to-date browser helping finding out partially missing / assumed to be modified names from evidence collected in the [Isdal Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isdal_Woman) case.

Some additional links at the [bottom](#do-you-remember-this-woman) of this page.

*TL;DR* The basic idea is identifying an original name based on the leftovers, by brute-forcing a list of possibly relevant first and last names against characters we think we could still recognise.

## I still don't get how this works?

In other words - if we know that:

- A name - that we don't know - consisted of three letters,
- started with **A**
- the second letter was **c** or **d**

and we have huge lists of all names used in the world - we can just go through all of them! 

That is exactly what this piece of software does. And it will tell us `Acy,Ada,Adi,Ad√®` among others.

If our original assumptions üîù were correct, and we did have a list containing all names ever used in the world - the name we were looking for is one of those we got as a result. 

## The eczema cream tube

This evidence - a tube of eczema cream - is pictured [here](https://imgur.com/a/GWErhsA). There is another, large image of it [here](1ivtA9cvDXk6cGu2tuk39Qxd_19Mb9TWlcZkfZSXv7Og.jpg).

As we can see, most of the original name of the patient it was prescribed to is scraped off from the label (also the date, and the doctor's name).

- The label was made on a typewriter, therefore it is monospaced - the characters are fixed-length.
- The first name probably consisted of seven characters.

It is useful to find images of *sans-serif* typefaces used in the typewriters of the sixties for comparison. The Lucida Sans font is somewhat similar:

This original idea stems from the book *Kvinnen i Isdalen*, by Dennis Zacher Aske - ISBN 9788241916601. 

## Options

- It is possible to choose different lists of names on the right side.
- Custom names can be added as: `Alpha,Bravo,Charlie` etc., and will be treated as the built-in ones.
- If *Fixed length names* is checked, the length of a possible name should be equal to the length we look for - if it is 4, and we set the first `A`, then `Anne,Abby,Alma` etc. will be found.
- But if it is unchecked, the shorter names will be found too - `Ali,Ana,Amy` in addition to the 4-character long ones.

## Presets

There are a few settings pre-defined - so to get a rough idea, just click on the *My idea 1* button for instance. Also if you can only recognize a round character at the beginning and perhaps an *I* afterwards, try the *Minimal* preset - it just shows results for that.

# Isdal Woman travels (Work In Progress)

So we still don't know what she did outside of Norway - between April 1 and October 29. But it is in the code which we more or less know how to interpret! 

All possible connections between location names in Europe starting with the letters she gave in the 2nd and 3rd "column" are here:

[Isdal Woman's trips?](trip.md)

Also her Norwegian trip is included so we can compare the method to the trip we have all details at hand.

Only places having more than 50k inhabitants are looked at, and there has to be at least 150km between the "stops" of a trip. Also certain countries are excluded now which I found irrelevant.

The complete results (all possible trips) could be downloaded ~~HERE~~. (coming back soon)

Without [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/) this wouldn't have been possible.
